### A simple AngularDart (2+) demo web app using the USDA Farmers Market service

#### Components/Dependencies

 - [Dart][dart] language - 1.24.2
 - [AngularDart][angular-dart] web framework - 3.1
 - [Sass][sass-main]
 - [Bootstrap4][bootstrap]
 - See *pubspec.yaml* and *index.html* for additional dependencies

#### Running Locally

 - Install the Dart SDK. Please visit the [Dart install page][dart-install] for additional instructions by operating system, but using [Homebrew][homebrew] is typical for Mac OS installations. 
 - Install [Sass][sass-install].
 - Download/clone the repository, open a terminal window, and go to the project directory.
 - Run the `pub get` command to retrieve Dart dependencies.
 - Run the `pub serve` command to launch a development server. 
 - Open a browser to [http://localhost:8080](). Using Chromium/Dartium, you'll see the app right away, but in other browsers, there will be a short delay while pub converts the app to JavaScript.
